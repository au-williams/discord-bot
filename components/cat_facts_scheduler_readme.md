# Cat Facts Scheduler

Thanks for signing up for Cat Facts! You will now receive fun daily facts about CATS! üê±

Example facts about cats:

- _"Cats have the largest eyes of any mammal."_
- _"A cat can sprint at about thirty-one miles per hour."_
- _"Like humans, cats tend to favor one paw over another."_
- _"Cats only sweat through their paws and nowhere else on their body."_

## Script ‚Äî [cat_facts_scheduler_script.js](cat_facts_scheduler_script.js)

This script runs every morning and fetches the [catfact.ninja API](https://catfact.ninja/) to send a new cat fact to each Discord channel. If todays schedule was missed when the bot was offline then a new cat fact will be sent on startup.

_Note: The [catfact.ninja API](https://catfact.ninja/) could use better data sanitization. It would be nice to dump the API responses into this modules config and pre-process them with a local LLM to fix grammatical errors and remove duplicate facts of different phrasing._
